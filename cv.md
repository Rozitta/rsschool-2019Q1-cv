## Summary:

<p>Hello! Thank you for visiting my page. Let me introduce you to one of my personalities. :smirk: 
For more than 2 years, I plunged into the world of programming. This is a very exciting trip. I like to create and learn.</p>
<p>My main job is my clothing store, but this does not bother me every day to spend at least 2 hours on my favorite programming. I have already developed several sites: many one-page landing pages, a couple of multi-page sites and another site on the Laravel platform.</p>
<p>I do not have much experience in programming, but I have a great desire to learn and devote my life to this matter.</p>
and I really like this quote:</p>

>>> Always write the code as if it would be accompanied by a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
***Martin Golding***

<p> I live by this idea, I dig to the roots and try not only to copy and paste the code into the project, as long as it works, but to understand what I am writing and how I am writing, and why this or that function should be here. We, programmers, are also creators, and we must to write code with the soul.</p>
